Usage: %s [-n n] [-r r] [-c condition] [-hs]
Generates pseudorandom orchard networks with n leaves and r reticulations.

The following options can be set to modify the behaviour of the generator.

Mandatory:
-n n                    number of leaves
-r r                    number of reticulations

Restriction (optional):
-c, --condition none    generate orchard networks (default)
-c, --condition tc      restrict to tree-child networks
-c, --condition sf      restrict to stack-free networks

Misc (optional):
-s, --samples           number of samples to generate (not guaranteed)
-h, --help              Display this help message

Examples of usage:
- Generate 3 tree-child networks with 4 leaves and 2 reticulations
      %s -n4 -r2 -s4 -c tc
