Usage: %s [-n n] [-r r] [-c condition] [-hCSp]
Generates all orchard networks (in fact MCRSs) over {1,...,n} and r reticulations.

The following options can be set to modify the behaviour of the generator.

Mandatory:
-n n                    number of leaves
-r r                    number of reticulations

Restriction (optional):
-c, --condition none    generate orchard networks (default)
-c, --condition tc      restrict to tree-child networks
-c, --condition sf      restrict to stack-free networks

Misc (optional):
-p, --partials          generate all nets with <=r reticulations
-S, --print-sequence    print the generated MCRSs to stdout
-C, --print-count       print the total count of generated MCRSs to stdout
-m, --more-counts       print count of generated MCRSs for each r=0..R (-p and -C must be activated)
-h, --help              Display this help message

Examples of usage:
- Show all orchard networks with 3 leaves and exactly 1 reticulation
      %s -n3 -r1 -S

- Count all tree-child networks with 6 leaves
      %s -n6 -r5 -c tc -Cp
